This repo exists to demonstrate a bug in the
https://github.com/robocorp/robotframework-lsp/tree/master/robotframework-ls[Robot Framework LSP for VSCode].

== How to reproduce

. First run `poetry install` to install dependencies.
.. If you haven't yet installed Poetry itself, follow the directions
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation[here].

. Open a Poetry shell with `poetry shell`.

. Run the tests: `robot --pythonpath . .` (two dots). Tests should fail. This is
unexpected behavior,
https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#taking-resource-files-into-use[per the docs].

. Make the resource path in `tests/test_a.robot` absolute by adding
`resources/`. Tests should pass. However, notice there is still an error related
to importing `NonexistentLibrary`. This is expected behavior.
